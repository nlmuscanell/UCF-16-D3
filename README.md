# Data Journalism and D3

D3 was used to create an interactive scattplot based on census data. The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

To make the plot interactive, two labels were added to each axis along with click events so that users can toggle between different variables for each axis. Additional a tooltip function was included with a hover/hide event -- to allow users to see data for each state in the United States (i.e., when hovering over each state dot).
